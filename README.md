### Synopsis

We are trying to bring bike sharing to Des Moines, Iowa so we are sharing some of the results of out analysis of NYC to show when would be the best time for bike sharing and whom uses the bikes the most so we can target those people with our launch in Iowa.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze NYC Citi-Bike data so we can plan a launch in Iowa with success. In this analysis we show many things including the peak hours of use in the month of August the average trip duartion by age, the average trip duration, trips per weekday per hour, by gender, bike utilization and plenty more. There is an attached tableau story above which best shows the results from the analysis. It seems that the bike sharing business is hot and should boom in Iowa aslong as it is scaled based on the population of the city and the need for transportation.

## Results
