### Synopsis

We are trying to bring bike sharing to Des Moines, Iowa so we are sharing some of the results of out analysis of NYC to show when would be the best time for bike sharing and whom uses the bikes the most so we can target those people with our launch in Iowa.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze NYC Citi-Bike data so we can plan a launch in Iowa with success. In this analysis we show many things including the peak hours of use in the month of August the average trip duartion by age, the average trip duration, trips per weekday per hour, by gender, bike utilization and plenty more. There is an attached tableau story above which best shows the results from the analysis. It seems that the bike sharing business is hot and should boom in Iowa aslong as it is scaled based on the population of the city and the need for transportation.

## Results

### Visualizations

We have provided 8 different visualizations...
The first is of August peak Hours and as you can see 7am-8pm are the hours with the most use.

Second is the Average Trip Duration based of age, which shows that age really doesn't matter for the use of bikes.

Third is checkout Times for users which shows that the average ride length is between 15-20minutes per ride.

Fourth is the checkout time by gender which shows very similar information as the Third pic showing ride length averaging about 15-20minutes.

Fifth is a heatmap of the trips per weekday per hour which shows similar results as previous showing 7am-8pm are the peak ride hours.

Sixth we divide the heatmap into 3 sections based on gender so show that its almost the same across all genders the use time of 7am-8pm.
![image6](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/bikesharing/blob/main/pictures/Screenshot%202022-08-27%20155405.png)
Seventh we show a heatmap of trips by gender per weekday which shows that most of the use comes from subscribers versus base customers.

And lastly, eighth we show bike utilization which shows that the bikes are all being used similarly with some (favorite bikes) being used more frequently.

## Summary

### Additional data

The analysis is very clean and nicely put together all showing 1 thing mainly that the main use times of the bikes are 7am-8pm across all genders and across all ages. However there are a few things we should show to further benefit our investors in the Iowa project. First would be how frequently the bikes fail to operate whether due to technology or mechanical issues. Second we should add the cost of the bikes and which style of bike is being used most frequently. And third we should add data about the cost and if there is an increase in cost during peak times when most of the bikes are in use. I beleive these 3 additional key points would benefit any investor in the Iowa project.
